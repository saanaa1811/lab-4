         <h1> Difference between Google Doc and HTML </h1>
         <p> Google Docs are very convenient for use with the formatting toolbar being easily displayed on the page.
            HTML documents are code based and need to be manually coded while using tags for subdividing and overall layout.
            Google Docs is also favorable when it comes to collaboration since people can both edit and write comments. HTML while they can be
            shared but they
            are needed tools to collaborative with it.
            Additional article created in Google Docs can share and publish easily with single share option,But need HTML
            to be run on a web
            web should host server to make it open.
            HTML has its advantage and can be made as flexible as needed In fact it presents options for doing the advanced stylization and scripting through
            CSS and JavaScript
            On the plus side, Google Docs is a flexible tool while on the flip side it lacks possibilities of completely developing own design and commands.</p>
