    <!-- 
a) Edit the markup for section#1 to have a level 1 heading that says "Emphasis and strengthened text"

b) Edit the markup for section#2 to also have a 2nd level heading that says "... Separating content from presentation"

c) Edit the markup for section#1 to have a paragraph with some emphasized and some strong text. Make sure that you use <strong> and <em> tags.

d) Make a level 3 heading in section#2 of your markdown that says "Explanation"

<body>
    <section id="1">
        <h1>Emphasis and strengthened text</h1>
        <p>In this example we have <em>emphasized/em> the words.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="2">
        <h2>Separating content from presentation</h2>
        <h3>explaining</h3>
        <p>using '<em>' and '<strong>' tag are better than '<i>' and '<b>'tag as it makes more sense in the text.
            The `<em>` tag means that the text is useful for screen readers and the `<strong>` tag means that the text is strong importance. 
            This make them easier to find and also helps the search engines to understand the content of page 
            better then the `<i>` and `<b>`, which only change the style of the text but does not give any meaning.</p>
