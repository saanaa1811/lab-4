                This needs focus because every piece of type has to be positioned properly in order to print into words and sentences.</p>

        <h3> Distinguish between Typesetting as a print technique, and desktop publishing or web technologies.
            as is the case with HTML and CSS provide more flexibility and performance.
            Desktop publishing allows for quick and easy change and the integration of multimedia while HTML and CSS offer an
            experience that can hardly be provided by typesetting.</h3>
